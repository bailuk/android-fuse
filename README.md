# Android-fuse

Mounts an android device using FUSE.

Requires [fusepy](https://github.com/terencehonles/fusepy) and that `adb` be
present in the PATH.

Usage:

    python android-fuse.py <mount-point>

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND MAY DO UNDEFINED THINGS TO YOUR PHONE, INCLUDING
DESTROYING DATA!

Only the operations that I needed for my own use were implemented.
